Something want to say to myself
Today is January 19th,2023 and it's been a long time since I wrote the code last time.
I have wasted long time.
At the beginning of winter vacation , I made up my mind to study English well for the exam next year.
So I  gave up writing code every day to save time to learn Englisg,but I gradually realized that this was wrong.
I don't study English well every day and I wasted a lot of time I could have written code.
So today I want to find my hobby again.


First of all, I want to thank this programmer.She is excellent, and many places are worth learning.
And I will copy the blog code by use vite + vue3
